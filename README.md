accidental or otherwise. Landlord shall not be liable to Tenant for damage to or loss of property which may be lost or stolen, damaged or
destroyed by fire, water, steam, or otherwise, unless caused by the omission, fault, negligence or other misconduct of the Landlord. In no
event, other than provided by statute, shall Landlord's liability for loss or damage to property exceed the replacement value or cost thereof,
whichever is lower. Landlord shall have the right, at his election, to have any damage repaired or to replace a destroyed item for which he is
liable and upon such repair or replacement, excepting any statutory liability, Landlord's liability shall cease. Landlord will not be liable for
damage to property caused by independent contractors working in the premises, the building or the grounds thereof.

be used solely for the storage of fuel in the tanks provided, where applicable, and laundry where such facilities exist at the commencement of
the term and for no other purpose.
12. Landlord and Landlord’s representatives may enter the premises to inspect the premises, to make repairs thereto or to show the premises
to a prospective tenant, purchaser, mortgagee or its agents pursuant to the applicable laws of the Commonwealth. Landlord and Landlord’s
representatives may also enter onto the premises in accordance with a court order, if the premises appear to have been abandoned by the
tenant, or to inspect, within the last thirty days of the tenancy or after either party has given notice to the other of intention to terminate the
tenancy, or for determining the amount of damage, if any, to the premises which would be cause for deduction from any security deposit held
by the Landlord. If the Tenant refuses to permit such entry directly or indirectly, then this lease may be terminated upon seven (7) days'
written notice. Except as otherwise provided by any law, failure by Tenant to permit Landlord access to premises to make repair shall relieve
Landlord of such obligation for the period which access has been denied and no abatement of rent may be taken by tenant for such periods. If
the failure or refusal of access causes damage to property of Landlord or others, Tenant shall be responsible for such damage.
13. DESTRUCTION-If the premises shall be partially damaged by fire or other cause without the fault or neglect of the Tenant or his family,
the damage shall be reasonably repaired by and at the expense of the Landlord, and until such repairs are completed, the rent shall be
equitably abated according to the extent of the damage. Pursuant to M.G.L. c. 175 § 99, each Tenant who is displaced by fire shall be eligible
for a relocation benefit from the Landlord's Insurance Company. In any such instance, the Landlord will provide any and all necessary
information and direction for the prompt payment of this relocation benefit. Landlord shall not be liable for delay in repair occasioned by
reason of adjustment in insurance covering such damage or for any reason beyond Landlord's reasonable control. The preceding
notwithstanding, if the premises are damaged so as to be untenable, or if the building is substantially damaged, Landlord may, within sixty
(60) days after such damage, give Tenant notice of termination, whereupon the term of this Lease shall expire upon the fifth day after such
notice is given and Tenant shall vacate the premises. If the premises is rendered untenable due to the casualty and is not restored to a
condition substantially suitable for tenancy within thirty (30) days following said casualty, the tenant may terminate this lease within thirty
(30) days thereafter by written notification to the Landlord. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to relieve Tenant of any liability to
Landlord for damage caused by tenant or his invitee, including but not limited to lost rentals for the balance of the terms of the leases then
unexpired in the building or any structure damaged through such action.
14. EMINENT DOMAIN - If the whole or any part of the premises or the building shall be taken by condemnation or the power of eminent
domain, then the term of this Lease shall terminate on the date when possession of the part so taken shall be required by the condemning
authority. Tenant hereby assigns to Landlord all claims and demands for damage on account of such taking and for compensation for
anything lawfully done pursuant to public authority excepting any relocation benefits provided by law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
both the premises and the building are not rendered untenantable by such taking, either party by notice to the other given within thirty (30)
days of such taking, may elect to continue the term hereof, in which event there shall be an equitable adjustment of the rent according to the
nature and extent of the damage sustained by such taking. If Landlord thereafter shall restore the premises, in whole or in part, as nearly as
possible to their condition immediately prior to such taking, there shall be an equitable readjustment of the rent.
15. SUBLETTING, NUMBER OF OCCUPANTS - The Tenant shall not assign or underlet any part or whole of the premises, license the use
of the premises, rent any room therein, nor permit any other person to occupy the premises other than the persons identified as occupants in
the Tenant's application to landlord ("permitted occupants"), without first obtaining for each sublease, assignment, license or otherwise
Landlord's written consent. Such consent once having been given shall be required for all subsequent occasions. Any guest of Tenant who
occupies the premises for a period of three (3) consecutive weeks or longer or who occupies on a regular basis but not continuous basis shall
be deemed an illegal subtenant for purposes of this lease whether or not rent is charged to or paid by such person.
Tenant may not place or permit to be placed any name upon the mailbox of Tenant other than Tenant and the permitted occupants. In the
event that children are born during the term of this lease or any extension or renewal thereof, then the tenant shall promptly notify Landlord
prior to or at time of such event. Children born to Tenant during the term of this lease shall be permitted occupants provided the total number
of occupants does not exceed the legal occupancy limits.
No roommate changes or substitutions may be made without Landlord's written consent in each instance. If Landlord agrees to any such
change, it shall always be conditioned upon, among other factors, said new person meeting Landlord's rental criteria and also upon a written
notice form being executed by Tenant and approved by Landlord in which the departing roommate waives all rights and interest in the lease,
security deposit, prepaid rent (and interest in either) and transfers the same to the new roommate. The form shall further require signature by
the new roommate and all other remaining roommates acknowledging that they are all bound by all of the terms and provisions of this lease.
Landlord may require each new roommate to execute this Lease as Tenant. No new roommate change shall be effective and no roommate

Tenant Lead Law Notification
What lead paint forms must owners of rental units give to tenants?
Before renting a home built before 1978, the property owner and the new tenant must sign two copies of this Tenant Lead LawNotification andTenant
Certification Form, and the property owner must give the tenant one of the signed copies to keep. If any of the following forms exist for the unit,
tenants must also be given a copy of them: lead inspection or risk assessment report, Letter of Compliance, or Letter of Interim Control. This form
is for compliancewithbothMassachusetts and federal leadnotificationrequirements.
What is lead poisoning and who is at risk to be lead poisoned?
Lead poisoning is a disease. It is most dangerous for children under six years old. It can cause permanent harm to young children's brain, kidneys,
nervous system and red blood cells. Even at low levels, lead in children's bodies can slow growth and cause learning and behavior problems. Young
children are more easily and more seriously poisoned than others, but older children and adults can become lead poisoned too. Lead in the body of a
pregnant woman can hurt her baby before birth and cause problems with the pregnancy. Adults who become lead poisoned canhave problems having
children, and can have high bloodpressure, stomach problems, nerve problems, memory problems and muscle and joint pain.
How do children and adults become lead poisoned?
Lead is often found in paint on the inside and outside of homes built before 1978. The lead paint in these homes causes almost all lead poisoning in
young children. The main way children get lead poisoningis from swallowing lead paint dust and chips. Lead is so harmful that even a small amount
canpoison a child. Lead paint under layers of nonleaded paint can still poison children, especially when it is disturbed, such as through normal wear
and tear and home repair work.
Lead paint dust and chips in the home most often come from peeling or chipping leadpainted surfaces; leadpaint on moving parts of windows or on
window parts that are rubbed bymoving parts; leadpaint on surfaces that get bumped or walked on, such as floors, porches, stairs, and woodwork;
and lead paint on surfaces that stick out which a child may be able to mouth such as window sills.
Most lead poisoning is caused by children's normal behavior of putting their hands or other things in their mouths. If their hands or these objects
have touched lead dust, this may add lead to their bodies. A child can also get lead from other sources, such as soil and water, but these rarely
cause lead poisoning by themselves. Lead can be found in soil near old, lead-paintedhomes. If children play in bare, leaded soil, or eat vegetables
or fruits grown in such soil, or if leaded soil is tracked into the home from outside and gets on children's hands or toys, lead may enter their
bodies. Most adult lead poisoning is caused by adults breathing in or swallowing lead dust at work, or if they live in older homes with lead paint, through home repair.
How can you find out if someone is lead poisoned?
Most people who are lead poisoned do not have any special symptoms. The only way to find out if a child is lead poisoned is to have his or her blood
tested. Children in Massachusetts must be tested at least once a year from the time they are between nine months and one year old until they are four
years old. Your doctor, other health care provider, or Board of Health can do this. A lead poisoned child will need medical care. A home with lead paint
must be deleaded for a lead poisoned child to get well.
What kind of homes are more likely to have lead paint?
In 1978, the United States government banned lead from house paint. Lead paint can be found in all types of homes built before 1978: single￾family and multi-family; homes in cities, suburbs or the countryside; private housing or state or federal public housing. The older the home, the more
likely it is to have lead paint. The older the paint, the higher its lead content is likely to be.
Can regular home repairs cause lead poisoning?
There is a danger of lead poisoning any time painted surfaces inside or outside the home are scraped for repainting, or woodwork is stripped or
removed, or windows or walls are removed. This is because lead paint is found in almost all Massachusetts homes built before 1978, and so many
of Massachusetts's homes are old. Special care must be taken whenever home repair work is done. No one should use power sanders, open
flame torches, or heat guns to remove lead paint, since these methods create a lot of lead dust and fumes. Ask the owner of your home if a lead
inspection has been done. The inspection report will tell you which surfaces have lead paint and need extra care in setting up for repair work,
doing the repairs and cleaning up afterward. Temporarily move your family(especially children and pregnant women) out of the home while the
repair work is being done and cleaned up. If this is not possible, tape up plastic sheets to completely seal off the area where the work is being done
to reduce the danger of lead dust. Hundreds of cases of childhoodand adult lead poisoning happen each year from repair work.
What can you do to prevent lead poisoning?
0Talk to your child's doctor about lead.
0Have your child tested for lead at least once a year until he/she is four years old.
0
Ask theowner if your home has been deleadedor call the state Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention Program (CLPPP) at 1-800-532-9571, or your
localBoard of Health.

0
Tell the owner if you have a new baby, or if a new child under six years old lives with you.
0
lf your home was deleaded, but has peeling paint, tell and write the owner. If he/she does not respond, call CLPPP or your local Board of Health.
0
lf your home has not been deleaded, you can do some things to reduce temporarily the chances of your child becoming lead poisoned. You can
clean your home regularly with paper towels and any household detergent and warm water to wipe up dust and loose paint chips. Rub hard to get rid
of more lead. When you are done, put the dirty paper towels in a plastic bag and throw them out. The areas to clean most often are window wells,
sills, and floors. Wash your child's hands often (especially before eating and sleeping) and wash your child's toys, bottles and pacifiers often. Make
sure your child eats foods with lots of calcium and iron, avoid foods and snacks that are high in fat. If you think your soil may have lead in it, have it
tested. Use a door mat to help prevent dirt from getting into your house. Cover bare leaded dirt by planting grass or bushes, and use mats, bark
mulch or other ground covers under swings and slides. Plant gardens away from old homes or in pots using new soil. Remember, the only way to
permanently lower the risk of your child getting lead poisoned is to have your home deleaded if it contains lead paint.
How do you find out where lead paint hazards may be in a home?
The only way to know for sure is to have a lead inspection or risk assessment done. The lead inspector will test the surfaces of your home and give
the landlord and you a written report that tells you where there is lead in amounts that are a hazard by state law. Forinterim control, a temporary way
to have your home made safe from lead hazards, a risk assessor does a lead inspection plus a risk assessment. During a risk assessment, the
home is checked for the most serious lead hazards, which must be fixed right away. The risk assessor would give the landlord and you a written
report of the areas with too much lead and the serious lead hazards. Lead inspectors and risk assessors have been trained, licensed by the
Department of Public Health, and have sulfide solution, a portable x-ray fluorescence machine or lab tests of paint samples. You canget a list of
licensed lead inspectors and riskassessors from CLPPP.
In Massachusetts, what must the owner of a home built before 1978 do if a child under six years old lives there?
An owner of a home in Massachusetts built before 1978 must have the home inspected for lead if a child under six years old lives there. If lead hazards are
found, the home must be deleaded or brought under interim control. Only a licensed deleader may do high-risk deleading work, such as removing lead paint
or repairing chipping and peeling lead paint. You can get a list of licensed deleaders from the state Department of Labor and Workforce development.
Deleaders are trained to use safe methods to prepare to work, do the deleading, and clean up. Either a deleader, the owner or someone who works for the
owner who is not a licensed deleader can do certain other deleading and interim control work. After the work is done, the lead inspector or risk 
assessor checks the home. He or she may take dust samples to test for lead, to make sure the home has been properly cleaned up. After getting one of
these fetters, the owner must care of the home and make sure there is no peeling paint.
What is Letter of Compliance?
It is a legal letter under state law that says either that there are no lead paint hazards or that the home has been deleaded. The letter signed and
dated by a licensed lead inspector.
What is a Letter of Interim Control?
It is a legal letter under state law that says the work necessary to make the home temporarily safe from lead hazards has been done. The letter is
signed and dated by a licensed lead risk assessor. It is good for one year, but can be renewed for one more year. The owner must fully delead the
home and get a Letter of Compliance before the second year.

Memorandum
To: All Tenants
From: The Samia Companies LLC
Re: Missing Packages
Date: April 14, 2023
Residents continue to report missing and open packages. This is a serious concern as this
is a criminal matter. If you experience a missing/stolen or opened package you should first
contact the Boston Police Department, then the company you ordered the package from
and then The Samia Companies, LLC.
Here are some suggestions residents can do on their own to help with the issue:
 Be vigilant when expecting packages to arrive, and if possible specify or select a
delivery time
 Consider having packages delivered elsewhere, to your office, or to someone you
know will be home during the day
 Request that a signature be required for every delivery, so that the package cannot
be left in the common area of the building and be susceptible to theft.
 Communicate this issue to the companies you order from and their delivery service
providers (USPS, UPS, Amazon, FedEx, etc), as well as your credit card issuer,
 they may have preventive solutions and may be obligated to assist or compensate
with a loss
 If possible, request insurance on delivered contents, or use a credit card with
applicable consumer protections.
There are additional security measures residents can take, such as remembering to not let
anyone into the building whom they do not know, and be wary of loitering individuals who
may try to get into the building behind you after you open the door. Also refuse entry to
anyone you don’t know who buzzes your unit on the intercom asking to be let into the
building. When coming and going from the building, be sure that the door closes completely
behind you, and report broken doors and locks in a timely manner. Do not prop open doors
or tape over locks, and remove any obstructions that prevent the door from closing
completely. If you notice any suspicious activity or people, report it to the police immediately
and then feel free to inform us at The Samia Companies, LLC.
If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to contact the office. Thank you for
your cooperation in keeping our buildings safe and secure.

under the terms of this Addendum shall be deemed an

IMPORTANT
REGARDING RENTER’S INSURANCE
Your LEASE and HANDBOOK state clearly that the 
Landlord is not responsible to loss or damage to 
your personal property under any circumstance. This 
includes loss or damage due to theft or other 
circumstances, even if the Landlord is responsible. 
The LEASE and HANDBOOK clearly state that you 
must purchase renter’s insurance to insure your 
personal belongings, as well as any liability that you 
may have. 
It is very important that, if you have not already done 
so, you contact an insurance agent immediately and 
purchase a Renter’s Insurance Policy. 
The Landlord will never take responsibility for the 
cost of loss or damage to your personal property 
because you failed to insure them.
